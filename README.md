# StegPro

## ABOUT <br>
StegPro is a steganography application that is able to hide images into other images. The program includes two options: encoding and decoding. It uses Least Significant Bit steganography method in which least significant bit of pixels of the image is replaced with data bits. As a result we have stego-image (encoded image) that contains embedded data as hidden.

## 1.	ENCODING <br>
Click on the "Encode" button to hide an image into another image. Chose the images by using "Browse" button and click on "Submit". The program will start encoding the image and when it is done, notify you with "Image is successfully encoded" message. If you want to save the encoded image, click on "Save Asâ€¦" button. Please note that only .png extension can be used while saving an image.

## 2.	DECODING <br>
Chose "Decode" option if you want to extract hidden image from encoded image. Chose the encoded image and click on "Submit" button. The program will start decoding the image and when it is done, notify you with "Image is successfully decoded" message. Click on "Save As..." button to save it.
